_**Not really a fan of addressing myself as the 3rd person, so yeah here you go.**_

I am a Backend Developer, and have a major crush on Javascript. I mainly work with Node.js and React, and trying to document my developer journey here just to be accountable to myself.

This blog is something that's relatively new. Maybe it's not something you would like to know but **IF** you wanna see my previous blogs, you can find them at [parasg1999.github.io](https://parasg1999.github.io)

P.S. Trying to learn to play Guitar these days ðŸ™ˆ
